module DataKitten

  # Represents a single dataset from some origin (see {http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset dcat:Dataset} 
  # for relevant vocabulary).
  #
  # Designed to be created with a URI to the dataset, and then to work out metadata from there.
  # 
  # Currently supports Datasets hosted in Git (and optionally on GitHub), and which 
  # use the Datapackage metadata format.
  #
  # @example Load a Dataset from a git repository
  #   dataset = Dataset.new(access_url: 'git://github.com/theodi/dataset-metadata-survey.git')
  #   dataset.supported?         # => true
  #   dataset.origin             # => :git
  #   dataset.host               # => :github
  #   dataset.publishing_format  # => :datapackage
